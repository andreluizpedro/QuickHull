# QuickHull
A small and brief implementation of the QuickHull algorithm for determining the points in a convex hull in 2D.  
  
Quick Hull is an algorithm with average time complexity of O(nlogn) but in cases where the points are heavily on one side of a split, the algorithm can have a worse case complexity of O(n^2)
